## 🔍 Workflow Summary

### 1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
- Combined multiple open datasets on air pollution and sustainable energy
- Standardized country names, years, and measurement units
- Removed missing and inconsistent entries

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Identified correlations between energy sources (renewable vs non-renewable) and pollution levels  
- Visualized country-wise and time-series trends

### 3. **Feature Engineering & Preprocessing**
- Scaled numerical features and encoded categorical variables  
- Handled multicollinearity and outliers  
- Selected top predictors for modeling

### 4. **Machine Learning Models**
Implemented and compared several regressors:
- `Support Vector Regression (SVR)`
- `ElasticNet Regression`
- `Random Forest Regressor`
- `XGBoost Regressor`
- `Stacking Ensemble`

### 5. **Model Evaluation**
- Evaluated using **RMSE** and **R²** metrics  
- Ensemble methods provided the most consistent predictions  
- Final Kaggle score: **2.213**
